										"Carnotaurus was one of the most bizarre
										yet dangerous meat-eating dinosaurs ever
										found. Its skull was short, with spiked
										armor in the form of feature scales
										across its body (skin impressions show
										this, although it is unknown around the
										face since the impressions for that area
										were destroyed) on the top and a pair of
										knobby horns over its small eyes. The
										neck and shoulder blades were well
										developed, but the arms were incredibly
										short, with forearms so shrunken they
										were practically just wrists; not even
										Tyrannosaurus rex had such small arms.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										With its small skull and weak bite
										force, Carnotaurus might not have been
										able to attack big plant-eaters, but it
										was probably fast due to its long and
										powerfully built legs and could have
										easily chased down smaller, agile
										prey.[1] In fact, research has indicated
										that despite Carnotaurus’ small head,
										its jaws were able to open very widely
										apart from other theropod dinosaurs in
										order to catch prey.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										The horns of Carnotaurus look something
										like those of a bull - and like a bull,
										it may have used them in contests with
										others of its own species. In this way,
										two Carnotaurus could test each other's
										strength without either of them
										seriously injuring the other.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Carnotaurus has become quite famous as a
										result of its starring role in the
										Disney animated film Dinosaur, however
										the animal depicted in the film are
										closer in size to Tyrannosaurus rex than
										the actual real Carnotaurus."

										"Stegosaurus is easily one of the best
										known dinosaurs and is recognized all
										over the world. It is the largest and
										most famous member of the stegosaur
										family. It roamed the open plains of the
										Late Jurassic Period in what is now
										North America. The plates along its
										back, its small head and spiked tail
										make it a peculiar and unique dinosaur.
										This plant-eater evolved to find its
										food in the low-growing plants of the
										late Jurassic. The spikes on its tail
										would have made a powerful weapon
										against any hungry predators.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Stegosaurus is often called the dumbest
										dinosaur because of its incredibly small
										brain. In fact, most scientists
										originally believed that its brain was
										too small to control such a large
										creature and that it used an auxiliary
										"brain" located above its rear legs to
										help control its movements. This was not
										actually a brain, but a bundle of nerves
										that helped relay information from its
										real brain. Its brain was once thought
										to have been the size of a walnut, but
										CAT-scans proved that it was actually
										the size of a kitten.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Most fascinating to people are the
										plates along its back. There has been a
										great deal of debate about their use and
										arrangement. The plates were up to
										2-feet tall and 2-feet wide (0.6
										meters). The most prevalent theory is
										that they were used for cooling or
										heating the animal. A more recent
										theory, however, suggests that they
										could have been used as a display during
										courtship and that they may have been
										brightly colored. It is also possible
										that they could move up and down,
										perhaps to intimidate predators.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										The spikes on its tail are also the
										subjects of some controversy. For years,
										every model of Stegosaurus showed it
										with the spikes sticking up into the
										air. It is only since the 1990s that it
										has become accepted that these spikes
										stuck out horizontal to the ground,
										which would have been a potent defensive
										weapon when swung at a hunter.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Stegosaurus would have lived in family
										groups and herds, moving slowly through
										forests while eating the low-growing
										plants. Its front legs were considerably
										shorter than it's hind legs, making it
										adapted to nibbling the plants closest
										to the ground. Stegosaurus is the
										namesake for a large family of dinosaurs
										whose members were found all over the
										world. The Stegosaurus (its code name
										"Stego") was a peaceful herbivore and
										probably roamed the prehistoric
										highlands in herds that size from small
										to large numbers, grazing on low ground
										plants. An average Stegosaurus was about
										the size of an elephant, standing about
										11 feet tall. It had a very low
										intelligence (its brain was the size of
										a kitten). The bony plates on it's back
										may have served a dual purpose of a body
										temperature regulation and protection
										from large flesh-eating predators.
										Different species varied in the number
										of plates on their back."

										"Parasaurolophus was a large,
										herbivorous, or plant-eating, dinosaur
										that inhabited North America during the
										late Cretaceous period, about 65 to 98
										million years ago. Parasaurolophus is
										classified as a member of the family
										Hadrosauridae, which contains the
										crested, duckbilled dinosaurs and
										belongs to the order Ornithischia (the
										bird-hipped dinosaurs). Hadrosauridae is
										subdivided into two subfamilies based
										upon the structure of the cranial crest.
										The hadrosaurine duckbills, such as
										Maiasaura, either lacked crests or had
										crests of solid bone. The lambeosaurine
										duckbills, including Parasaurolophus,
										Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus, had
										showy, hollow crests.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Apart from its bill, which was shorter
										than that of other hadrosaurs, the most
										distinctive feature of Parasaurolophus
										was its hornlike crest, which reached up
										to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length and
										curved back from the head. This
										attribute inspired the name
										Parasaurolophus, which means “beside
										Saurolophus,” referring to another
										crested dinosaur. Inside the crest,
										which may have been shorter in females,
										paired nasal passages extended from the
										nostrils to the tip and then curved back
										down to the snout. Although
										paleontologists are not certain of the
										crest’s function, many believe that it
										served as a resonating chamber,
										producing a distinctive bellow that
										allowed conspecifics—that is, members of
										the same species—to communicate. While
										Parasaurolophus moved through heavy
										brush, the crest may have tucked into an
										unusual notch in the spine at the point
										where the crest abutted the back. In
										this position, the crest would have
										cleared a path by sweeping vegetation up
										or sideways, away from the body, in a
										manner similar to that of the cassowary,
										a modern bird.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Parasaurolophus grew to an adult length
										of about 33 feet (10 meters), height of
										15 feet (4.6 meters), and weight of 3 to
										4 tons. Like all hadrosaurs,
										Parasaurolophus had long hind limbs and
										shorter forelimbs. Although it probably
										moved on all fours while foraging,
										presumably it was capable of sprinting
										away from predators on its rear legs.
										Parasaurolophus had a tail with an
										unusually broad base, which has caused
										paleontologists to speculate that it may
										have been used as a signaling device,
										either in courtship displays or possibly
										as another identifier among
										conspecifics."
									</span>

									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										The first fossil evidence of
										Parasaurolophus was found in the

										"Mosasaur, (family Mosasauridae),
										extinct group of aquatic lizards that
										attained a high degree of adaptation to
										the marine environment and were
										distributed worldwide during the
										Cretaceous Period. The mosasaurs
										competed with other marine reptiles—the
										plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs—for food,
										which consisted largely of ammonoids,
										fish, and cuttlefish. Many mosasaurs of
										the Late Cretaceous were large. The
										longest mosasaurs, based on a specimen
										of Mosasaurus hoffmanni, are estimated
										to have been 17 metres (about 56 feet)
										in length, but the most common forms
										were no larger than modern porpoises.
									</span>
									<span class="dinosaur-note">
										Mosasaurs had a snakelike body with a
										large skull and a long snout. Their
										limbs were modified into paddles having
										shorter limb bones and more numerous
										finger and toe bones than those of their
										ancestors. The tail region of the body
										was long, and its end was slightly
										downcurved in a manner similar to that
										of the early ichthyosaurs. The backbone
										consisted of more than 100 vertebrae.
										The structure of the skull was very
										similar to that of the modern monitor
										lizards, to which mosasaurs are related.
										The jaws bore many conical, slightly
										recurved teeth set in individual
										sockets. The jawbones are notable in
										that they were jointed near mid-length
										(as in some of the advanced monitors)
										and connected in front by ligaments
										only. This arrangement enabled the
										animals not only to open the mouth by
										lowering the mandible but also to extend
										the lower jaws sideways while feeding on
										large prey."
